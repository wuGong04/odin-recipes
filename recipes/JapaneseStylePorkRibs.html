        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple, Japanese-style, braised baby back ribs recipe that's simply delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 pounds baby back pork ribs </li>	
            <li> ⅔ cup soy sauce </li>	
            <li> ⅓ cup sake </li>	
            <li> 3 tablespoons honey </li>	
            <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>	
            <li> 4 cups water </li>	
            <li> 2 cups uncooked white rice </li>	
            <li> 3 medium (4-1/8" long)s green onions, thinly sliced </li>	 
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the silvery skin from the back of the ribs by sliding the pointed end of a meat thermometer under the skin and pulling up. Pat the ribs dry with paper towels and cut into individual ribs.</li>

            <li>Mix soy sauce, sake, and honey together in a small bowl and set aside.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot. Sear the ribs in batches until browned and they have a nice crust, about 3 minutes per side. Remove ribs to a plate and set aside.</li>

            <li>Drain Dutch oven of any excess oil. Carefully pour soy sauce mixture into the pot and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula to release any stuck-on bits. Add ribs to the pot with the liquid and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a boil. Cover tightly and remove from heat.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until ribs are tender and no longer pink, about 2 1/2 hours, flipping over halfway through cooking time.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

            <li>Serve ribs and sauce with white rice and sprinkle with green onions.</li>
